For OER delivered as web pages, 'static website generators' such as **Jekyll** build websites from source code and may provide "everything you need to create, manage, and publish" OER (Williamson, 2018a).

Combined with a version control system this OER source code may be openly shared and adapted, **not hiding** in a database.

GitHub Pages is a free web-based version control system with Jekyll built in that provides an easy place to start (Williamson, 2018b).
