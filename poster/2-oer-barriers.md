Anderson (2013) suggests some practical barriers to OER success include: 

- Permanence: Digital information is ephemeral and OER can be lost over time
- Quality: OER production may lack copy-editing/design support, and be updated infrequently
- Time: Finding, creating and remixing OER is time-consuming

These barriers certainly reflect my experience of OER. But is 'open source' any different?
